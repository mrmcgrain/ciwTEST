getting the questions to randomism and then conditionally randomizing the options based on 'Both" proved alot...ai is gay
next plans our to add context to persist the state and maybe a database of sorts, 


<!-- 

[
    {
        "question": "1. What does CSS stand for?",
        "options": [
            "Cascading Style Sheets",
            "Colorful Style Sheets",
            "Computer Style Sheets",
            "Creative Style Sheets"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Cascading Style Sheets"
    },
    {
        "question": "2. Which HTML tag is used to define an internal style sheet?",
        "options": [
            "<style>",
            "<css>",
            "<script>",
            "<link>"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "<style>"
    }
]

using the above format, create a  test for javascript, include array methods, manipulating a object, functions, arrow functions, string methods, OOP, functional programming , etc
